# Climate-Change-Prediction
• Developed a predictive model using ARIMA to forecast temperature, sea level, CO2 emissions, and humidity trends over the next decade based on real-world data.

• Employed time series analysis to model climate variables and fine-tuned ARIMA parameters to achieve optimal forecast accuracy.

• Utilized Python (Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels) for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model implementation.
